    \q    to Quit.
    \?    lists Special Commands.
    :?    lists Edit-Buffer/History commands.
    *?    lists PL commands.
    /?    displays help on how to set and use macros (incl. functions).

SPECIAL Commands begin with '\' and execute when you hit ENTER.
EDIT-BUFFER / HISTORY Commands begin with ':' and execute when you hit ENTER.
PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE commands begin with '*' and end when you hit ENTER.
MACRO executions and definitions begin with '/' and end when you hit ENTER.
All other lines comprise SQL Statements (or comments).
  SQL Statements are terminated by either unquoted ';' (which executes the
  statement), or a blank line (which moves the statement into the edit buffer
  without executing).
After turning on variable expansion with command "*" (or any other PL
command), PL variables may be used in most commands like so:  *{PLVARNAME}.
Be aware when using regular expressions on commands, that the regex.s
operate only on the command text after the * or \ prefix, if any.
